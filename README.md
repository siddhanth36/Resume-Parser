# Resume Parser üîç

A Python command-line tool that extracts key information from PDF resumes, such as contact details, skills, and education.

## Features
- Extracts email addresses and phone numbers using regex.
- Identifies a list of predefined technical skills.
- Detects common education keywords.
- Simple heuristic for finding a candidate's name.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/siddhanth36/Resume-Parser.git
    cd resume-parser
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install PyPDF2
    ```

3.  **Run the parser:**
    ```bash
    python3 resume_parser.py path/to/your/resume.pdf
    ```

## How It Works
1.  **Text Extraction:** Uses `PyPDF2` to pull text from a PDF file.
2.  **Pattern Matching:** Uses regular expressions (`re`) to search for specific patterns like emails, phones, and keywords related to skills and education.

## Limitations
- Name extraction is a simple heuristic and often unreliable.
- The quality of parsing depends heavily on the resume's layout and formatting.
- It is a basic parser designed for demonstration purposes. Commercial parsers use much more sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with a proper NLP library (e.g., `spaCy`) for better name and entity recognition.
- Add support for DOCX files using `python-docx`.
- Create a simple GUI or web interface using Flask.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
